<p>Analyzing the best kdramas with the help of data and ratings gathered from MyDramaList and Python Code. Hope that this is a good and enjoyable read.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Let's Begin:</b><br /></p><p>&nbsp;If you are looking for direct on-to-the point answer then, according to MyDramaList website, the answer is <b><a href="https://www.netflix.com/np/title/80990381" target="_blank">Move to Heaven</a> </b>(an original Netflix series, starring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Je-hoon" target="_blank" title="Lee Je-hoon">Lee Je-hoon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Jun-sang" target="_blank">Tang Jun_sang</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Seung-hee" target="_blank">Hong Seung-hee</a>) with a massive rating of 9.2 out of 10.&nbsp;</p><p></p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://image.kpopmap.com/2021/04/move-to-heaven-netflix-poster.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="640" height="691" src="https://image.kpopmap.com/2021/04/move-to-heaven-netflix-poster.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>pic: Move to Heaven</i><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>But if you're here for a little bit of in-depth analysis then you've come to the right place. As a kdrama fan and a data analysis enthusiast, I decided to try and merge these two different things and find something to work and spend time on. This was a fun experience for me so I wanted to share it with you guys and hope that it'd be fun for you too.</p><p><u><b>Step 1: Data Gathering&nbsp; <br /></b></u></p><p>The first step was Data Gathering which wasn't that difficult of step because of the dataset uploaded in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahbab911/top-250-korean-dramas-kdrama-dataset" target="_blank">kaggle</a><b>. </b>The dataset contained data from the top-ranked 250 Korean Dramas as per 
the MyDramaList website. The data had been collected and uploaded in the
 form of a CSV file and was allowed to be used on various Data Science 
Projects. </p><p><b><u>Step 2: Data Modification</u></b></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i>I downloaded the CSV file and opened it in MS Excel. I realized that there were alot of columns that were not required or important enough for me so I made some modifications and then uploaded it to the<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fc0pfTOWA3JBCHaJcwk73ihm8FovKI4Q#scrollTo=ZewWYq-tZxVE" target="_blank"> Google Collab</a> file that I was going to work on. Again, thanks to the already freely available, well organized dataset I didn't have much problem.So I moved on to the next step smoothly,</p><p><b><u>Step 3: Analysis and Visualization</u></b><br /></p><p>This is the part from which I started to use python code to analyze the data that I had in my hands and distributed <br />
